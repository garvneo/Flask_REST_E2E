This is an end to end Flask REST API project! It is built with the intention of learning, improving mind mapping and practical knowledge on the said tech stack and is up and running on Render.com.

## What the API Does

Think of the API as the bridge between your app and the servers. It lets your app talk to the system and vice versa. Here's what you can do with it:

1. **Create Stores**: You can ask the system to create new stores, giving users more options.
2. **Manage Items**: Add new items to stores, making sure the inventory stays fresh and exciting.
3. **Retrieve Data**: Get all the details about stores and their items whenever needed.

## How to Talk to the API [ API documentation [here](https://flask-rest-apis-e2e.onrender.com/swagger-ui)]

Just like talking to a friend, the API has specific ways to communicate. Here are the main ones:

- **Store Creation**: Say "create a store" with `POST /store`
- **Item Management**: Add a new item with `POST /store/<store_name>/item`
- **Data Retrieval**: Ask for information with `GET` requests to various endpoints.

## How the API Talks Back

When you ask for something, it replies in a language your app understands: JSON. It's structured and easy to work with, making communication smooth and efficient.

## Where to Find It

The project is live and kicking on [Render.com](https://flask-rest-apis-e2e.onrender.com). Plus, it's integrated with Swagger UI, so you can explore and interact with the API easily. You can find the Swagger documentation UI [here](https://flask-rest-apis-e2e.onrender.com/swagger-ui).

## What Powers the Project

The project is an end-to-end Flask API project, designed to handle various aspects of data management and communication. It leverages a robust stack of technologies:

- **Framework**: Flask
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Flask-JWT-Extended
- **Data Validation**: Marshmallow
- **API Documentation**: Swagger
- **Background Tasks**: Redis
- **Containerization**: Docker

## Acknowledgements and References

I would like to acknowledge the invaluable assistance and guidance provided by various tutorials, online resources, and forums throughout the development of this project. Specifically, I found the following platforms to be particularly insightful and instrumental:

- **Tutorial Series on Flask Development**: Udemy
- **Documentation and Community Forums on Flask and Marshmallow**: Flask Documentation and Marshmallow Documentation
- **Online Tutorials and Guides on Docker and Redis Integration**: Docker Documentation and Redis Documentation
